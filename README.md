# Lab2
4/20/20 Update
Launch project was tested based on the input provided and works completely
Tube project only partially works when using the input provided
Child one does not terminate properly and I can tell this based on the status of child 1
status of Child 1 is no equal to 0 when printing out its value
Child 2 terminates properly and I can tell this because the status of Child 2 is 0 when
printing out its value
